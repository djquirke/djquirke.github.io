		<p>This site will evolve as I progress through my web development journey</p>
		<h1>Journey</h1>
		<p>I am learning through <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn" target="_blank">freecodecamp.org</a>'s "Responsive Web Design Certification"
		<p>After completing the Basic HTML and HTML5, Basic CSS and Applied Visual Design sections, I wanted to test my skills, using <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io" target="_blank">Frontendmentor.io</a>'s newbie challenges.</p>
		<p>This gained me some confidence to head back to FreeCodeCamp's course to complete it, including sections on flex box and grid.</p>
		<p>The links in the FreeCodeCamp section shows the various sites made at the end of the course.</p>
		<p>I am rapidly gaining confidence and enjoying working with HTML/CSS, with my biggest struggle being to remember all the various elements, attributes and styling options at hand.</p>
